---

## Claude Code — Custom Skills (this project)

| Skill | Scope | When to run |
|---|---|---|
| `/arch-audit` | Claude Code architecture compliance: fetches latest Anthropic docs + release notes, compares with local `.claude/` setup, auto-fixes safe items | Weekly (SessionStart hook warns if ≥7 days). Timestamp: `~/.claude/projects/.../last-audit` |
| `/ui-audit [screenshots]` | **shadcn compliance only**: design tokens (G1–G8), component adoption (S1–S5), accessibility attrs, table layout rules. Static + optional live screenshots. Does NOT cover UX flows or responsiveness. | After any UI wave, before merging a worktree |
| `/ui-audit screenshots full` | Same as above but captures all routes via Playwright | Full pre-merge review |
| `/responsive-audit` | Breakpoints 375/768/1024px — only collab+responsabile routes (admin excluded). 6 checks: overflow, table scaling, text truncation, 44px tap targets, stacked layout, modal fit. PASS/WARN/FAIL per route×breakpoint | After layout or grid changes |
| `/ux-audit` | User experience quality: simulates F1–F7 + F-onboarding flows (standard) or full via Playwright per role. Evaluates 7 UX dimensions D1–D7 (D7 = structured user confidence framework C1-C5: Cancel path, Destructive guard, Silent success prevention, Constraint visibility, Positive feedback). Severity-ranked report Critical/Major/Minor with fix proposals | Before feature releases, after significant flow changes |
| `/visual-audit [quick\|full\|critique] [target:page:<route>]` | Aesthetic quality: takes live screenshots in light + dark mode, scores each page on 11 visual dimensions V1–V11 (typography, spatial rhythm, focal point, colour, density, dark-mode, micro-polish, contrast, Gestalt, typographic quality, interaction states). Score /55. Critique mode: deep-dive on single route with Gestalt + hierarchy diagnosis + before/after redesign proposals. | On demand — when the app "looks wrong" or before a client demo |
| `/phase-design` | **Non user-invocable** — invoked by pipeline.md Phase 1.6. Visual & UX design phase: consistency check → wireframe → HTML preview → UX rationale → Design Quality Gate (10 criteria including eye-path, typography scale, touch targets, component state spec). Runs on Opus 4.7. | Automatic in Phase 1.6 when triggers are met |
| `/skill-dev` | Code quality and technical debt: coupling, duplication, dead code, pattern inconsistencies, magic strings, `@ts-ignore`, prop drilling, over-large components. Uses `docs/sitemap.md` as guide. Outputs to `docs/refactoring-backlog.md` | Periodically — before major refactoring, quarterly review |
| `/skill-db` | DB schema and query quality: missing indexes, normalization, RLS gaps, constraint completeness, N+1 in API routes, cascade behavior. Uses `docs/db-map.md` as guide. Outputs to `docs/refactoring-backlog.md` | After any migration wave; before production releases |
| `/security-audit` | Security review: auth guards on all routes, RLS completeness, Zod coverage, sensitive data in responses, HTTP security headers, proxy bypass. Internal app — SEO/indexing out of scope. Outputs to `docs/refactoring-backlog.md` | Before each production deploy; after adding new API routes |
| `/api-design` | API consistency: HTTP verb correctness, URL structure, response shape, error codes, pagination patterns, validation placement. Outputs to `docs/refactoring-backlog.md` | After adding 3+ new routes; quarterly |
| `/perf-audit` | Performance: server/client boundaries, unnecessary `use client`, heavy lib bundling, useEffect data fetching, image optimization, unbounded queries, serial awaits. Internal app — CWV/SEO out of scope. Outputs to `docs/refactoring-backlog.md` | Before production releases; after major UI additions |
| `/resend-verify [template:E<N>] [action:<desc>] [broadcast]` | Email delivery verification via Resend MCP: domain health (SPF/DKIM), delivery status, from address, CTA link domain, personalization token rendering. Template-specific checks for E1–E14. | After any action that triggers a transactional email (Phase 5c) |
| `/commit` | Conventional Commits 1.0.0 compliant commit: reads staged diff, determines type+scope, writes imperative description ≤72 chars, executes. Handles BREAKING CHANGE footer. Model: Haiku. | Phase 3 intermediate commit · Phase 8 docs commit · Phase 8 context commit |
| `/humanize [domain]` | Removes AI-generated patterns from prose written for human audiences (project docs, GDoc changelog, README, announcements). Domains: `email`, `contratto`, `comunicazione`, `generico` (default). EN + IT + mixed. Null-state aware: returns text unchanged if no AI patterns detected. Anti-hallucination: never invents replacements — removes unverifiable claims rather than fabricating sources. <50-word inputs: vocabulary-only pass. | On demand — before publishing GDoc changelog entries, README sections, announcements, or any prose Claude wrote that external users will read |

> **Rule**: every new custom skill must be added to this table immediately after creation.
> **Prerequisites for screenshot-based skills**: `npm run dev` must be running on `localhost:3001` (worktree) or `localhost:3000` (main).
> **MCP Playwright**: uses bundled Chromium (`--browser chromium`) — no conflict with open Chrome. Requires Claude Code restart after `~/.claude.json` changes.
